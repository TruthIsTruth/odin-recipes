        <p>
            "Growing up, chicken schnitzel was a classic. I decided to make this dish
            oven-friendly using less oil, and an easier cleanup. This dish tastes great
            with potato salad, or mashed potatoes and a nice crisp salad. Tastes great 
            the next day cold too! It's a family-favorite! Enjoy with fresh squeezed 
            lemon juice. " - <em>By Chef V</em>
