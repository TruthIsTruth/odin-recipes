# Project: Recipes

This is the first project from "The Odin Project". The aim of this project is to build a basic recipe website using the foundational knowledge acquired of HTML. It consists of a main index page which has some links to a few recipes.

In this project, I will have demonstrated that I am capable of:
* creating a basic functional web page using HTML.
* editing the written content of a web page.
* formatting the structure of the content and the text of a web page using HTML tags.
* adding links to other web pages
* adding pictures to a web site
