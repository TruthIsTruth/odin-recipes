# Project: Recipes

This is the first project from "The Odin Project". The aim of this project is to build a basic recipe website using the foundational knowledge acquired of HTML. It consists of a main index page which has some links to a few recipes.

In this project, I will have demonstrated that I am capable of:
* creating a basic functional web page
* editing the written content of a web page
* formatting the structure of the content of a web page
* adding absolute and realtive links to other web pages
* adding pictures to a web site
