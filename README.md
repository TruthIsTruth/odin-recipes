This is the first project from "The Odin Project". The aim of this project is to build a basic recipe website using the foundational knowledge acquired of HTML. It consists of a main index page which has some links to a few recipes.

In this project, I will have demonstrated that I am capable of:
    · creating a basic functional web page
    · editing the written content of a web page using headings, lists, and text formatting (bold text, italic text)
    · adding absolute and realtive links to other web pages
    · adding pictures to a web site
